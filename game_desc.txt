#In this game, the user controls a rocket ship on the bottom of the screen. Play can move the ship left and right using the 
#arrow keys and shoot with spacebar. When the game begins, aliens fill the sky and move across and down the screen. The player
#shoots and destroys the aliens. If the player destroys all the aliens, a new fleet appears that move faster than the previous
#fleet. If any alien hits the player's ships or reaches the bottom of the screen, the player loses a ship. If the player loses
#three ships, the game ends.
